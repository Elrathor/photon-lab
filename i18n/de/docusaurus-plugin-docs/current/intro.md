# Introduction

Alright! You want to learn to take analog pictures. You now stand in front of a map for the journey to your first analog picture ahead. 

## Why?
While the discussion of the philosophy of digital vs. analog photography needs a deeper discussion than this introduction can provide, it's likely safe to assume, that you have your own reasons to try the analog process. Photography in general is more than... wait, that's for the history section. Let's say: The idea of photography is quite old in the general scope of technology. In a time when more young people want to try this art form and more and more old people, who know about it, leave us, the knowledge of the "old way" of doing photography can be hard to come by. This is the main reason why the **Photon Lab** was created. A single place to get information and help and do so for free and openly. Let's get started, shall we?

## Getting started

In theory, analog photography is really simple. Ok, admittedly it's more complicated than that, but that's something for later. On a high level, it's just a two-, but most often three-step process:
1. Step: **[Take the photo](/docs/photography/Intro)** - You need a dark box of some sort, a light-sensitive medium, and the capability to expose the light-sensitive medium to a focused beam of light for a controlled amount of time. The thing that does all of those things is called a camera.
2. Step: **[Develop the photo](/docs/development/Intro)** - Assuming you used a chemical process to create the light-sensitive medium, you now need to stop it from being sensitive to light. Looking at it, an inherently light-based process, would be very difficult otherwise. If you don't want to develop your own film, we can do it for you for a really good price if you're willing to wait. 
3. Step: **[Print the photo](/docs/printing/Intro)** - In theory, you could stop at the previous step, but it is much more convenient to print a picture, as the most commonly used medium (35mm film) produces quite tiny (35mm high, duh) pictures, which, making things worse, are also transparent. Not quite the experience people talk about when they talk about photography. It is much more practical to print the image on photographic paper or take the route of digitizing and then printing them via a contemporary inkjet color printer.

There are chapters dedicated to each of those topics. Take a look at their respective introductions to get started, or, if you are so inclined, first visit a [short journey through the history of photography](/docs/0-history/Intro.md). Before there was 35mm film, photography was a bit like the early days of 3D printing. Very interesting, very cool, but also very much not standardized.
