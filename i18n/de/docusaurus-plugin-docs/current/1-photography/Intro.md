# Photography Introduction

After our first endevours into the history of photography, we leave the theory behind and adventure into the practical.

## Understanding The Camera

Our camera is our main tool and partner in creative crime. Wether you're using a smartphone, a point-and-shoot, a DSLR or an analog SLR, the fundamental principles of photography remain the same. The following are the basic settings (or properties) always assossiated with your camera:

- **Aperture:** This refers to the size of the opening in your lens that allows light to enter the camera.  A wider aperture (smaller f-number, like f/1.8) lets in more light and creates a shallow depth of field, blurring the background and making your subject stand out.  A narrower aperture (larger f-number, like f/16) lets in less light and creates a deeper depth of field, keeping everything in focus.

- **Shutter Speed:** This controls how long the camera's sensor is exposed to light.  A fast shutter speed (e.g., 1/1000th of a second) freezes motion, perfect for capturing action shots.  A slow shutter speed (e.g., 1/30th of a second) allows for motion blur, creating a sense of movement and often used for capturing light trails or flowing water.

- **ISO:** This measures the sensitivity of your camera's sensor to light.  A lower ISO (e.g., 100) is ideal for well-lit situations and produces cleaner images.  A higher ISO (e.g., 3200) is useful in low-light conditions, but can introduce noise or grain into your photos. In analog SLRs this value represents the light sensitivity of the use film stock and isn't changeble.
